    <p class="text--bold">What for you is the appeal of landscape photography?</p>
    <p>Landscape photography takes me to many beautiful and extraordinary places – places I might not have visited if I didn’t have the added motivation of taking photos. The best, most atmospheric light and conditions are typically at dawn and dusk, so I often have the landscape all to myself and can enjoy a genuine feeling of isolation and scale. Being outdoors, lost within such a big, wild landscape, is great for the soul – I love being out in all weathers and feeling the force of nature. Landscape photography can provide an excuse (if we needed one) to reconnect with nature, which is vital in an age when so many of us spend too long confined indoors, in front of screens, or drowning in social media. In addition, photography is a creative outlet – an opportunity to be expressive, innovative and capture the world around us just as we see it. It is no surprise that landscape photography is growing in popularity.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">How did you first get into it?</p>
    <p>I got into photography really young, when my parents gave me a compact camera as a Christmas present. I guess I was 9 or 10-years-old at the time. I already loved the outdoors, so I instinctively wanted to take landscapes. I can actually still remember taking my very first shots – at a local Cornish beach on Boxing Day. Living in Cornwall, we are surrounded by beautiful coast and countryside, so it really is an ideal place to be based in my profession. </p>

    <p class="text--bold">What do you love about Cornwall?</p>
    <p>I love the big, far-reaching sandy beaches, the large crashing waves, clean surf and rugged coastline. I love the way of life – the slow pace, peace, space and outdoor lifestyle. We own a barn conversion with several acres of woodland and live just a short drive from the beach. Our kids love the freedom they have, and their favourite day is spent on the beach bodyboarding and splashing about in the sea – followed by a beach BBQ. Cornwall is home to some amazing wildlife, which I also enjoy photographing. Although I’m not Cornish – my parents moved to Cornwall when I was 7-years-old – it is very much my home and I couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. And to top if off, we have pasties, cream teas and great cider – what more could you want?!</p>

    <p class="text--bold">What’s in your bag when you go for a shoot in Cornwall? </p>
    <p>Typically, I would carry two camera bodies and several lenses, covering a focal range from wide-angle to short telephoto (14mm-200mm). Also, in my camera backpack is an array of filters to help me balance the light or creatively lengthen exposure. I always carry a heavy tripod to ensure stability even in blowy Cornish weather. Sea spray can be a problem when taking seascapes, so a lens cloth and lens wipes are essential accessories too. My iPhone is also important – like many photographers, I use a number of Apps that help me predict the tide height, weather and position of the sun. This is important, as careful planning helps maximise the chances of capturing a successful shot.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">What are your go-to places for taking photos in the area?</p>
    <p>There are too many to mention – Cornwall is home to so many photogenic coves, fishing harbours, secluded beaches and stunning clifftop views. However, among my favourite spots to shoot are Trebarwith Strand, Bedruthan Steps and St Michael’s Mount. Trebarwith, near Tintagel, is a fantastic high-tide location. You can set-up on the Strand and photograph the waves as they rush by either side of you. Like many places in Cornwall, it is a location best shot at sunset. Bedruthan Steps, a few miles north of Newquay, must be among the most dramatic stretches of coastline anywhere in Europe. From the cliff tops you can shoot the huge sea stacks (or ‘Steps’). In spring, the cliff tops are often carpeted in wildflowers, creating colourful foreground interest. St Michael’s Mount is one of Cornwall’s most recognisable landmarks. At low tide, you can access the island via an old, cobbled causeway. Marazion beach is home to stunning tidal pools and rocky outcrops, which create great context when photographing the Mount. You are spoiled for choice when taking landscapes in Cornwall, but these are among the best places to visit with your camera when you holiday in the region.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">Tell us about your favourite shot and how it came about...</p>
    <p>If I’m being honest, I don’t have one. I have several images I’m fond of, maybe even proud of, but I don’t have a favourite. As a photographer, your style and skills are evolving all the time. You are constantly learning and improving – or you should be, at least! Therefore, I tend to look back at my photographs critically, rather than favourably. I’m never completely satisfied – I see faults in all my shots. And I think it is the desire to always do better that keeps me motivated – either to get up unsociably early, stay out late, or brave the elements. There is always a better shot.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">What tips would you offer an aspiring landscape photographer?</p>
    <p>Get out with your camera as much as you can. Create opportunities – make your own luck. Be inspired by other photographer’s work, but don’t imitate. Instead, find your own style and take the pictures you want to take. Trust your instincts as a photographer and most importantly, just have fun.</p>
