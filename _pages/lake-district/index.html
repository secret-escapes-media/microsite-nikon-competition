    <p class="text--bold">What for you is the appeal of landscape photography?</p>
    <p>Landscape photography allows me to explore all sorts of locations and admire the power of nature that has shaped the world we live in. It gives me an appreciation of weather systems and geology, and I feel by understanding these, I can use that knowledge to take images that showcase the amazing planet we live on.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">How did you first get into it?</p>
    <p>I’ve always been influenced by the landscape images of Ansel Adams. My summer holidays growing up were spent in the South Downs and Devon coastline and when I had my first SLR, I spent ages trying to recreate those images shooting slides and black & white film. I now find myself drawn to anywhere with mountains, waterfalls and rugged coastlines as they all make amazing locations for photography.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">What do you love about the Lake District?</p>
    <p>As a landscape photographer, the Lake District has everything I could ask for. Whether it’s shooting a serene sunrise or sunset across Blea Tarn, the textures on the scree slopes at Wastwater, walking up Great Gable, Catbells or Latrigg Fell for stunning panoramas; and that’s just the start. Don’t miss the grandeur of cathedral cavern and the picture-postcard images of Ashness Bridge or one of the many outlying Lake District villages. The views and the drive over Hardknott Pass to Honister Slate mine is another stunner, and - not for the faint-hearted - the images of Helvellyn from Striding Edge are jaw-dropping. </p>

    <p class="text--bold">What’s in your bag when you go for a shoot in the Lake District? </p>
    <p>Hiking is also a passion of mine, so if I’m going up another Wainwright or summit, I need to travel light. My main camera is a Z 7 and I carry two lenses, a 24-70mm S f/4 and a 14-30mm S f/4. I also have a tripod and a few ND and grad filters. My back-up camera is a Z 50 with a 16-50mm lens, this is a brilliant small travel camera that I would use for video, time-lapse or just putting in my pocket so I’m ready to capture whatever I see - be it landscapes, wildlife or people. The weather sealing on both cameras is excellent, so it’s not an issue even if I get caught out in adverse weather.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">What are your go-to places for taking photos in the area?</p>
    <p>There are so many locations to choose from in the Lake District, and they change radically depending on the season and light. I have listed some above, but there are just too many to list; as a starter, you should check out: Surprise View over Derwentwater, the boat piers at Coniston Water, the wooden boats lined up at Windermere and Derwentwater, and the lone tree and pine tree reflections at Buttermere. Also, if the weather conditions are right, you can shoot images of the Milky Way over Grasmere or at Honister. In winter and early spring, the images of snow-capped mountains around Keswick and Derwentwater are terrific as well.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">What makes a good landscape photograph? </p>
    <p>To me, great landscape photography is all about the light on the landscape, as it adds depth and dimension to your image. It could be a sunrise or sunset or a shaft of light breaking through the clouds on a stormy day, it really doesn’t matter. The Lake District offers all sorts of great light which can change very quickly, meaning you have many opportunities to shoot great images.  Composition is also key; I try to build my images around a single subject, to avoid complicated and messy photographs.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">Tell us about your favourite shot and how it came about...</p>
    <p>This was on a photography workshop I was leading for Nikon School in the Lakes. I love photographing the night sky and some of the group wanted to try astrophotography as well, but this isn’t officially part of the workshop. I’m always happy to go out with my camera if other people want to, although rousing a group of photographers that had been up from sunrise to leave a warm and cosy hotel on the off chance we could shoot the milky way was a challenge at 1:00 am. When we got to Grasmere, the tiredness faded away by just looking up at the star field, Milky Way and shooting stars. It was an amazing experience standing on the lakeshore taking images and listening to the owls and wildlife in complete darkness. The delegates rated this as the highlight of the week, even though it wasn’t part of the main workshop.</p>

    <p class="text--bold">What tips would you offer an aspiring landscape photographer?</p>
    <p>To get the best light, start getting up for sunrise and think about staying out for sunset or even Astro shoots. Generally, to get the best light for landscapes you will be shooting early or late in the day, especially in the summer. It also helps to plan your shoots, as it’s rare to just turn-up and find amazing light at a stunning location. I use a number of weather apps and tide charts to make sure I have the best chance of getting great images. The biggest technique tip for landscape photography I can give is to start shooting with wide-angle lenses such as 14mm and get low and close to your foreground subject. This will give you immersive images that draw your viewers eye into the frame.</p>
